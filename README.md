# Previous Projects
Here are some examples of some data analysis work I have done over my educational career.  The most important documents would be "Senior Thesis.pdf" and "SeniorThesisStataCode.do" which are the code and final paper for my Senior Honors Thesis I completed here at UCSD.  This was a faculty-led research group of only the top 10 students in the Economics department which focused on helping students complete high-level academic research projects.  My project focused on the potential effects that different school learning models used during the COVID-19 Pandemic had on enrollment rates in universities in the short and long term.  This type of econometrics-focused research relies heavily on using data science tools to format and analyze large groups of data.  The second example of my work would be within the document "MathProjectPython.ipynb".  This was a data analysis project that I created focused on using Python to see whether the effect the percentage of students using free and reduced lunches has on school attendance changed from before to after COVID-19.
